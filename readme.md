# Dependency check test

This project just tests the action. It does a checkout of the code to scan, builds a jar and runs dependency check against it. Then, it uploads the report as an artifact

A hello world would be needed to run this test. I suggest using something like https://github.com/hellokoding/springboot-jsp.git
